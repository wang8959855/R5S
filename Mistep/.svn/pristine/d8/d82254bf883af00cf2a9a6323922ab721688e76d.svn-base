SMTabbedSplitViewController
===========================

Tabbed Split View Controller for iPad is a custom split view controller, with vertical left tabbar control for navigation between master view controllers. Tabbar contains tabs for navigation between view controllers and actions buttons for some actions (for example, exit from application). Also it can be used without tabbar control as customizable alternative UISplitViewController.

Installation
--------------

SMTabbedSplitViewController can be installed via CocoaPods. Simply add
```
pod 'SMTabbedSplitViewController', '>= 1.0.3â€™
```
to your Podfile. 

If you don't use Cocoapods download and import SMTabbedSplitViewController folder into your project.

Then, subclass SMTabbedSplitViewController and override -init
```
#import "SMTabbedSplitViewController.h"
//or #import <SMTabbedSplitViewController.h> for CocoaPods
@interface ViewController : SMTabbedSplitViewController
```
or create instance of SMTabbedSplitViewController

```
SMTabbedSplitViewController *split = [[SMTabbedSplitViewController alloc] initTabbedSplit];
```
Use constructor -initTabbedSplit for create split with tabbar and -initSplit for create split without tabbar (default -init method called -initTabbedSplit) 

For create tabbar tabs you must create instance of view controller for this tab and use it when creating an object SMTabBarItem (also you can customize this tab item)
```
SMTestMasterViewController *tab1VC = [[SMTestMasterViewController alloc] init];
tab1VC.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0/255.0 green:127/255.0 blue:237/255.0 alpha:1.0];
SMTabBarItem *tab1 = [[SMTabBarItem alloc] initWithVC:tab1VC image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Twitter"] andTitle:@"Twitter"];
tab1.selectedImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Twitter_sel"];
```
and set a tabsViewControllers property
```
split.tabsViewControllers = @[tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5, tab6];
```
For create actions buttons you must create SMTabBarItem with another constructor accepts action block instead of the view controller (like create tabs)
```
SMTabBarItem *action = [[SMTabBarItem alloc] initWithActionBlock:^{  
UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"About" message:@"SMTabbedSplitViewController by Marchukov Sergey" delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil];
[alert show];
} image:[UIImage imageNamed:@"info"] andTitle:@"About"];
```
and set a tabsActions property
```
split.actionsButtons = @[action, action2];
```
For create split view controller without tabbar, you must set master and detail view controllers (without SMTabBarItem) in viewControllers property like UISplitViewController
```
split.viewControllers = @[masterVC, detailVC];
```
